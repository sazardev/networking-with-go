# Networking with Go - The easy way guide

Networking with Go is a full guide to learn how to build network applications with the Go programming language. This guide is divided into three main parts: Networking Theory and Concepts, Unified Networking Topics (Theory + Practice), and Cybersecurity & Hacking. You will first gain a deep understanding of networking fundamentals, protocols, and processes, then learn how to apply these concepts using Go with hands-on examples and projects, and finally explore cybersecurity and hacking topics relevant to networking and Go.
