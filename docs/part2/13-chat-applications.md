# Chat Applications: Design, Protocols, and Go Implementation üí¨

> "Imagine a group conversation where everyone can speak and listen in real time. Chat applications are the classic use case for WebSockets and real-time networking!"

---

## üö¶ Why Build a Chat Application?
- **Real-Time Communication:** Users expect instant delivery and receipt of messages.
- **Multi-User:** Many clients can join, send, and receive messages simultaneously.
- **Practical:** Chat is a foundation for collaborative tools, games, support systems, and more.
- **Learning:** Building a chat app teaches you about concurrency, broadcasting, and protocol design.

---

## üß© Chat Protocols and Architecture
- **WebSocket-Based:** Most modern chat apps use WebSockets for low-latency, bidirectional messaging.
- **Message Format:** Typically JSON (e.g., `{ "user": "Alice", "msg": "Hello!" }`).
- **Broadcast:** Server receives a message and sends it to all connected clients.
- **Rooms/Channels:** Advanced systems support multiple chat rooms or private messages.

## üèóÔ∏è Typical Chat Server Architecture

    Client1((Client 1))

    Client3((Client 3))
    Server["WebSocket Chat Server"]
    Client1 -- Connects --> Server
    Client2 -- Connects --> Server
    Client3 -- Connects --> Server
    Server -- Broadcasts messages --> Client1
    Server -- Broadcasts messages --> Client2
    Server -- Broadcasts messages --> Client3
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Go in Action: Minimal WebSocket Chat Server (Gorilla)

This example shows a minimal chat server using `gorilla/websocket`. All messages from any client are broadcast to all connected clients.

### How it works (step by step):
1. Clients connect to `/ws` and upgrade to WebSocket.
2. Each client is managed by a goroutine.
3. When a client sends a message, the server broadcasts it to all clients.
4. The server handles joining/leaving and message delivery.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ClientA
    participant ClientB
    participant Server
    ClientA->>Server: Connect (WebSocket)
    ClientB->>Server: Connect (WebSocket)
    ClientA->>Server: Send message
    Server-->>ClientA: Broadcast message
    Server-->>ClientB: Broadcast message
    Note over Server: Handles all clients and broadcasts
```

## üìù Example: Minimal Go WebSocket Chat Server (Gorilla)

See: [`main.go`](../../exercises/part2/13-chat-server-gorilla/main.go)

```go
// ...see exercises/part2/13-chat-server-gorilla/main.go for full code and comments...
```

**How to use:**
1. Install gorilla/websocket: `go get github.com/gorilla/websocket`
2. Run the server: `go run exercises/part2/13-chat-server-gorilla/main.go`
3. Connect with multiple browser tabs, `wscat`, or your own Go client to `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.
4. Type messages‚Äîeveryone sees all messages in real time.

**Understanding the code:**
- Each client connection is handled in its own goroutine.
- All messages are sent to a broadcast channel.
- The server loops over the broadcast channel and sends each message to all connected clients.
- If a client disconnects, it is removed from the list.

## üß† Key Takeaways
- Chat apps are a classic real-time networking challenge‚Äîperfect for learning concurrency, broadcasting, and protocol design.
- Use WebSockets for low-latency, bidirectional messaging.
- Manage clients and broadcasts with goroutines and channels in Go.
- For production, add authentication, rooms, message history, and error handling.

**How to use the Go client:**
1. Install gorilla/websocket: `go get github.com/gorilla/websocket`
2. Run the chat server: `go run exercises/part2/13-chat-server-gorilla/main.go`
3. In another terminal, run the client: `go run exercises/part2/13-chat-client-gorilla/main.go`
4. Type messages in the client‚Äîsee them broadcast to all connected clients (including browser tabs or other Go clients).
